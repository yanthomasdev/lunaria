import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The most efficient way to add Lunaria to your project is using the `create-lunaria` package, as shown in the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/). If you prefer to do this process manually, follow this guide instead.

## 1. Add the `@lunariajs/core` package

Lunaria is published through the `@lunariajs/core` package in the npm registry. Add it to your project by running the following command in its root directory:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, add the `lunaria` executable script as part of your `package.json`'s `scripts` field:

```json title="package.json" ins={5}
"scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview",
    "lunaria": "lunaria"
}
```

## 2. Create `lunaria.config.json`

Lunaria is configured using `lunaria.config.json`. This file is required so Lunaria knows about your repository structure and what should be tracked.

```json title="lunaria.config.json" mark={2}
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/@lunariajs/core/config.schema.json"
}
```

:::tip
`@lunariajs/core` comes with a JSON Schema you can refer to with the optional `$schema` property to add IntelliSense support in your code editor.

## 3. Configure the package

Before generating your first localization dashboard, you have to set up the `repository`, `defaultLocale`, and `locales` fields of your `lunaria.config.json` file.

The following example sets up Lunaria to track Markdown/MDX content for both English and Portuguese in a sample Astro project, hosted on `https://github.com/me/cool-project/`:

```json title="lunaria.config.json"
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/@lunariajs/core/config.schema.json",
	"repository": {
		"name": "me/cool-project"
	},
	"defaultLocale": {
		"label": "English",
		"lang": "en",
		"content": {
			"location": "src/content/en/**/*.{md,mdx}"
		}
	},
	"locales": [
		{
			"label": "Português",
			"lang": "pt",
			"content": {
				"location": "src/content/en/**/*.{md,mdx}"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Learn more about all the available options in the [Configuration Reference guide](/configuration-reference/).

## 4. Run Lunaria

Finally, you can generate your localization dashboard by running the `lunaria` script in the command line with your preferred package manager.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run lunaria
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run lunaria
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn run lunaria
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, the localization dashboard will be built to an `index.html` file in the `./dist/translation-status/` directory. This file can then be deployed to the hosting platform of your choice and shared across your contributors.
