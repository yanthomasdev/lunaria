TODO.

{/\*
Lunaria was made to help open-source communities feel empowered to handle complex localization projects, and thanks to our experience doing so, we've gathered a few suggestions on how to use Lunaria to its full potential.

## Keep pull requests small

- More friendly and resonable to new reviewers.
- Easier to keep track for changes, discuss, and iterate.
- Localization reaches users faster (use temporary branches in case everything has to be localized before publishing!)

## Use squashed merge commits

- Better control over the final status, especially when dealing with new contributors
- Tracker Directives can be used for fine-grained tracking status

## Empower the community

- Value the work of reviewers as well
- Create resources for new contributors to jump in
- Explain the project's localization architecture and Lunaria
