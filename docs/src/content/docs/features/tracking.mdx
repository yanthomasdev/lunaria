Lunaria implements an unique localization tracking system powered by Git. This guide explains how it works, how to manipulate it, and all its associated features.

## How tracking works

To track changes, Lunaria uses the repository's git history to compare the latest major commit date from the original and localized versions of a file, defining if the localization is outdated or complete if its latest commit happened after, or before, the original one's.

In Lunaria, a "major commit" is one that causes significant changes to content, and is determined according to the usage or not of [ignored keywords](#ignored-keywords) and [tracker directives](#tracker-directives) in a commit.
